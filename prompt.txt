NON-INTERACTIVE MODE: The notes appear below under "### NOTES ###". Do not ask for file paths or additional input. Produce the output immediately.

You are an assistant that reads a set of markdown notes and extracts structured study material.

### Task
From the given markdown notes, identify the key concepts, definitions, and important information that should be remembered for long-term learning and work productivity.

### Output format
Return a valid JSON array where each item has the following fields:

{
  "concept": "short name of the concept (1–5 words)",
  "short_summary": "concise 1–2 sentence summary of the concept based only on the note",
  "importance": <integer 1–10, where 10 = essential to remember, 1 = minor detail>,
  "tags": ["topic1","topic2"],     // infer relevant tags if possible
  "cards": [
    {"q": "short question about the concept", "a": "short answer"},
    {"q": "...", "a": "..."},
    {"q": "...", "a": "..."}
  ]
}

### Constraints
- Use only the information explicitly present in the notes.
- Do not invent or hallucinate facts.
- Keep language concise and clear.
- Ensure all output is valid JSON.
- Favor short, atomic questions that test recall (flashcard style).
- If a note contains action items or project-specific information, you may include them as "concepts" with questions like: "What decision was made in meeting X?" / "What action item was assigned?"

### Example (for illustration only)
Input note excerpt:
The likelihood ratio test compares the fit of two nested statistical models.
It is commonly used in hypothesis testing to decide if adding parameters significantly improves the model.

**Expected output:**
[
  {
    "concept": "Likelihood ratio test",
    "short_summary": "A statistical method that compares the fit of two nested models and helps decide if added parameters improve model fit.",
    "importance": 8,
    "tags": ["statistics","modeling","hypothesis-testing"],
    "cards": [
      {
        "q": "What does the likelihood ratio test compare?",
        "a": "The fit of two nested statistical models."
      },
      {
        "q": "In which type of analysis is the likelihood ratio test commonly used?",
        "a": "Hypothesis testing."
      },
      {
        "q": "What question does the likelihood ratio test help answer?",
        "a": "Whether adding parameters significantly improves the model fit."
      }
    ]
  }
]
